School-Grievance-System
=======================
Problem:

There are government schools in every locality all over Tamilnadu. Each school has its own set of problems and we often
hear students complaining that their school doesn't have proper toilets,water,food,etc. Students also go to their parents
and complain that their teachers don't teach properly or that their teacher beat them up. There are so many other issues
which come up in schools and there is no system to address these issues and schools never improve. Quality education and
god facilities are MUST for a school to run. It is important that every student is given the best education and the best
facilities. 

The system:
The School Grievance System will be a portal for parents and students to send their grievances about their school to the
'Education Officer' in their Constituency. The education officer will visit those schools which have the maximum number of
grievances. This visit would take place on every saturday.

Working of the system:
Every day, at midnight, the 'Complaints' daabase will be sorted with respect to number of grievances per school. The
education officer can visit the schools any time during the week to resolve the grievances. This is an optional visit.
However, the weekend visit will be mandatory. On Saturday morning, the Education Officer will get a mail telling him which
schools must be visited that day. He must go and resolve the grievances in all of those schools. So, for any grievance registered, the maximum resolve time would be 7 days. 

For students below 15 years of age, parents will register the complaints. Other students can register complaints on their own. Students must be warned that giving false complaints will lead to stringent action against them.

Advantage:
The advantage of this system is that it will ensure transparent functioning of the school system and students will be given the best facilities and education. 

Disadvantages:
The system might not be able to sell itself an effective system because people always think that such systems never work. Also, the implementation might be a Herculean task as we have to assign unique ID numbers to every student in Tamilnadu and appoint Education Officers for each of the 234 constituencies and have a team to ensure smooth functioning of the system. 

Scope:
The system is one for the future. This system will help in Unique Identification of each student in Tamilnadu and that would help in many other ways. Also, it will become a system where the students have a voice.
